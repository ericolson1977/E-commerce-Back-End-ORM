## Description
With the goal of utilizing the latest technologies for an e-commerce site, I finished building the back-end by modifying starter code. By adding my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an .env file, I can connect to that database using Sequelize. When I run schema and seed commands a development database is created and is seeded with test data. By entering the command to invoke the application my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the database. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products and tags, the date for each route is displayed in a formatted JSON. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia I can successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
